**Carbon Footprint Calculator**  

This is a web application built with Python and Streamlit that allows users to calculate their carbon footprint. The application collects user information, connects to their bank account using the Nordigen API for authorization, and utilizes the Genify API to calculate their carbon footprint. The calculated footprint and its breakdown by categories are then emailed to the user's provided email address.
